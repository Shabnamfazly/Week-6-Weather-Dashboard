# Week-6-Weather-Dashboard

## Description
This application uses the third-party API, OpenWeather, to retrieve weather data for cities and displays the weather (temperature, humidity, wind speed, and uv index) of the current day and the weather (temperature and humidity) for the five following days.Through building this application I learned how to properly retrieve data from a server side API.

## Usage 
The application is easy to use, just simply enter the name of a chosen location in the search bar and click the search button to be presented with the weather forecast for the next five days.
Below I have linked the deployed link as well as a screenshot of the application.
